# Genetic Algorithm Applied to Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

An implementation of genetic algorithm on Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/mjorrico/cvrp_genetic_algorithm
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  $ cd cvrp_genetic_algorithm
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start genetic algorithm

```bash
  $ python3 main.py
```

Editing `main.py` is required to change GA's parameters.
